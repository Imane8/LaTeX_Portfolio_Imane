# Project 4 - LaTeX Article Editing Portfolio

This repository showcases my work as a **LaTeX editor** and demonstrates my ability to professionally format and structure academic articles. 

## About This Project

- The project consists of a full article prepared in **LaTeX**, including title, abstract, sections, tables, and bibliography.
- All content is **properly formatted** for academic publishing standards.
- I handled:
  - Document structuring with `\section`, `\subsection`, and custom environments
  - Consistent styling of tables and figures
  - Bibliography management using BibTeX
  - Cross-references for tables, figures, and citations
  - Clean, readable LaTeX code suitable for professional use
